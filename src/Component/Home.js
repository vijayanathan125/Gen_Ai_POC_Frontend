            Our application is designed to streamline document search processes.
            By leveraging AI models, the system can analyze and understand the
            content of provided documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you submit a document to the AI model, it will use that
            document's content as a reference. Users can then ask questions, and
            the system will respond based on the information present in the
            document.
